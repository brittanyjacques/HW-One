Affirm Lending

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

Affirm

* When was the company incorporated

2012

* Who are the founders of the company? 

Max Levchin

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Levchin’s idea for affirm came from the thought of having an alternative consumer credit option other than credit cards. Most lending services extend credit to borrowers based on their credit score, which can seemingly be black and white. Affirm had the idea to pull information on potential borrowers such as social media information or proprietary marketing databases and combines this with credit score to have a more holistic picture of the borrower. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Max Levchin is a co-founder of Paypal and received funding from another co-found of Paypal Peter Thiel’s venture firm Founders Fund. Affirm has raised over $1.3 billion in funding from investors. 


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

The company’s focus is to solve the issue of assuming massive debt through credit cards by providing consumers with an alternative short-term financing option. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
The merchants that use Affirm intend to reach lower-income consumers who might not be able to afford to pay for the products upfront. Affirm is ranked as #86 in payment processing with a market share of 49%. The company offers its borrowers to set the timeframe regarding when they will pay back the loan where many competitors will require 4 bi-weekly payments. Additionally, Affirm will not affect the borrower’s credit score. The company does a soft pull credit check that requires no obligation to use.  

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Affirm uses applied machine learning technology to allow for real-time approval/denial decisions for the plethora of requests that the company receives daily. The machine learning interface collects data on how likely an applicant will pay their loan back and is set into the Affirm history portfolio. 

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

The company is in the lending sector of the financial industry. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
There is a shift from traditional lending through banks and credit unions to Fintech lenders. The brick-and-mortar walk in services are quickly shifting to online platforms, which has become cheaper and more accessible. Fintech lenders are increasing market share due to consumers going online first to find better offers. One example is peer-to-peer lending where no deposits are necessary, and individuals can earn interest by lending to others. Fintech lending also offer faster approvals and funding typically less than 24 hours. Just as Affirm does, the lenders collect data from alternative sources not just credit score to determine the likelihood on whether the borrow will pay the loan back. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Affirm, AVANT, Credit Karma

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
The company has seen rapid growth with regard to revenue, user adoption, and merchant partnership. Affirm seeks to disrupt the lending industry by providing millennials and the Gen Z demographic alternate consumer-financing and friendlier options. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
The company measures the gross merchandise volume to assess the volume of transactions that take place on its platform. Affirm has a belief that by having active merchants this is a useful performance indicator to the company and its investors.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Compared to its competitors, Affirm has a few unique features that many of its competitors do not offer. As mentioned, the ability to choose the timeframe for payback, 0%, 10%, or 30%, interest rates, and its specifically available for use with its merchants. One competitor, Avant, is set up very similarly such as the ability to pay the loan off in installments for lower credit score borrowers. The company does not limit what the loan can be used for but does not provide the ability to set the terms. Based off of financials Affirm currently has 510 million in revenue where Avant currently has 316.7 million. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers,or use your imagination!)
Affirm only offers financing for specific merchants that parent with its platform. The company could potentially move into a larger market and take its methodology to provide larger financing for its borrowers like homes and cars.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

With the methodology that Affirm uses to approve potential borrowers this would be extremely helpful for those that wouldn’t necessarily be approved for car/home loans based solely on credit score. 


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Affirm would possibly need another machine learning interface to sort data for these types of loans. Car/home loans require larger financing so the newer interface would need to be designed to ask and gather specific data on potential borrowers that’s tailored to that. The app or website could also utilize AI to help consumers through the lending application depending on what they are looking for.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? 

This technology would be appropriate for the solution because its already in place at Affirm for its current loan providing services. The company would simply need to expand upon it to incorporate the new services.
